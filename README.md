# asdfer's i3
Forked [i3](https://github.com/i3/i3) to add minor features to my taste.

Automated Testing has been ignored because I don't know Perl.

**Modifications:**
- Force kill window
- Vertical(Fat decorations!) and horizontal(no need to add those pesky spaces in your title_format) Decoration paddings as a config
- Alternating window decoration colors for decorations that are clumped together
